# Features

## Camera Path Generation
- **Helper Mesh System**: Use any mesh object as a template for camera positions
- **Face-Based Camera Placement**: Automatically generates camera keyframes at each face center
- **Smart Camera Orientation**: Cameras face opposite to face normals for optimal coverage
- **Interior Camera Detection**: Option to skip cameras detected inside scene meshes using ray casting
- **Near Clipping Protection**: Automatically skips cameras too close to geometry

## Export Capabilities
- **Multi-Format Camera Export**:
  - LichtFeld Studio compatible format (default)
  - Postshot compatible simplified format
- **Camera Parameters**: Exports full intrinsics and extrinsics with 4x4 transform matrices
- **Scene Normalization**: Automatic AABB scale calculation for consistent processing
- **Coordinate System Options**: Support for both Y-up and Z-up coordinate systems

## Point Cloud Generation
- **Ray-Traced Point Clouds**: Converts selected meshes to accurately-colored PLY point clouds
- **GPU Acceleration**: Fast BVH-accelerated ray casting for improved performance
- **Multi-Frame Sampling**: Generates dense point clouds from multiple camera views
- **Stride Control**: Use every Nth frame for faster generation with fewer points
- **Color Preservation**: Captures rendered colors including lighting and materials

## Render Animation
- **Integrated Rendering**: Render animation directly from the Gauss Cannon panel
- **Engine Selection**: Choose render engine with Cycles-specific device and persistent data options
- **Native Render Window**: Opens Blender's render progress window with ESC-to-cancel
- **Render Farm Ready**: The render output path is stored relative to the saved .blend, so farm nodes write frames to the same `images/` folder
- **Depth & Normal Maps**: Optional exact depth and camera-space normal maps for depth/normal-supervised training in LichtFeld Studio and Spirula Studio

## User Interface
- **Step-by-Step Workflow**: Clear Steps 1–4 guide you through the full pipeline
- **Unified Output Folder**: Single folder for all exports (`transforms.json`, `pointcloud.ply`, `images/`)
- **Integrated Panel**: Clean UI in the 3D viewport's N-panel under "Gauss Cannon" tab
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows face counts, camera positions, and selected objects
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Icons show mesh visibility and selection status

# Requirements

- **Blender**: 5.0.0 or higher

To uninstall or update later, find Gauss Cannon under `Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions` (or the Add-ons tab) and use the dropdown arrow next to the entry.

# Usage

### Basic Workflow

### 1. Setup Helper Meshes
```
1. Select mesh objects to use as camera position templates
2. Click "Add Selected" in the Gauss Cannon panel
3. Helper meshes are automatically hidden from render
4. View face counts and mesh status in the list
```

### 2. Configure Output
```
1. Set the output folder (all exports go here)
2. Choose export mode (LichtFeld Studio or Postshot)
3. Select coordinate system (Y-up or Z-up)
```

### 3. Generate Camera Path (Step 1)
```
1. Configure focal length, resolution, and interior camera detection
2. Click "Generate Cameras"
3. Cameras are created at each face center
4. Timeline and render settings are updated automatically
```

### 4. Export Camera Data
```
1. Click "Export Camera JSON"
2. transforms.json is saved to your output folder
```

### 5. Generate Point Cloud
```
1. Select target meshes in the viewport (excluding helper meshes)
2. Configure settings:
   - Ray Density: 4-1024 (default: 8)
   - Stride: Use every Nth frame (default: 1)
   - GPU acceleration: Enable for faster processing
3. Click "Generate Point Cloud"
4. pointcloud.ply is saved to your output folder
```

### 6. Render Animation
```
1. Choose render engine (Cycles/EEVEE)
2. For Cycles: select device and persistent data options
3. Click "Render Animation"
4. Frames are rendered to the images/ subfolder
```

To render on a farm instead, save the .blend and submit it. The output path is
stored relative to the .blend (e.g. `//output/images/`) whenever the file is saved,
as long as the output folder is on the same drive.

### 7. Depth & Normal Maps (optional)
```
1. In Step 4, enable "Depth Maps" and/or "Normal Maps"
2. Click "Render Animation": passes are saved as EXRs in _passes/, then
   converted to depths/ and normals/ PNGs when the render finishes
```

The pass setup is saved in the .blend (view-layer passes plus compositor File
Output nodes), so a render farm produces the `_passes/` EXRs without the add-on
installed. After the farm finishes, click "Convert Depth/Normal Passes".
Turning both toggles off removes the compositor nodes again.

For depth supervision in LichtFeld Studio, the point cloud also needs to be dense
enough (Ray Density 32+, Stride 1). The panel warns when it isn't.

# Technical Details

## Camera JSON Export Formats

### LichtFeld Studio Format
```json
{
  "aabb_scale": 2.5,
  "w": 1080,
  "h": 1080,
  "camera_angle_x": 0.6911,
  "camera_angle_y": 0.6911,
  "fl_x": 1388.88,
  "fl_y": 1388.88,
  "cx": 540.0,
  "cy": 540.0,
  "frames": [
    {
      "transform_matrix": [["..."]],
      "file_path": "images/0001.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Postshot Format
```json
{
  "aabb_scale": 2.5,
  "w": 1080,
  "h": 1080,
  "camera_angle_x": 0.6911,
  "camera_angle_y": 0.6911,
  "cx": 540.0,
  "cy": 540.0,
  "frames": [
    {
      "transform_matrix": [["..."]],
      "file_path": "images/0001.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Point Cloud PLY Format
- **Format**: Binary little-endian PLY
- **Properties**: x, y, z positions + RGB colors
- **Coordinate System**: Configurable (Y-up or Z-up)
- **Color Range**: 0-255 per channel

## Depth & Normal Map Format
Written next to `images/` with matching filenames, where both LichtFeld Studio and
Spirula Studio look for them:

| | `depths/0001.png` | `normals/0001.png` |
|---|---|---|
| Format | 1-channel 16-bit PNG | 3-channel 8-bit PNG |
| Values | Planar z-depth × scale (one scale per scene) | Camera-space OpenCV axes (x right, y down, z forward), facing the camera, `round(127.5 + 127.5·n)` |
| Invalid / background | `0` | `(128, 128, 128)` |

`geometry_maps.json` records the depth scale (`depth = value / scale`, in Blender
units) and the encodings. Both trainers treat depth as scale-invariant, so the
scale only matters for your own tooling.

Enabling them in the trainers:
- **LichtFeld Studio**: `--use-depth-loss --use-normal-loss --normal-loss-space camera-opencv`.
  The depth loss is fitted to the initial point cloud, so export a dense
  `pointcloud.ply`. These losses are skipped with `--gut`.
- **Spirula Studio**: normals are used automatically; set `depth_supervision_weight`
  above 0 to use depth.

## Algorithm Details

### Interior Camera Detection
- Uses odd-even ray casting rule
- Counts mesh intersections along ray
- Odd count = inside mesh
- Excludes helper meshes from detection

### GPU Acceleration
- Utilizes Blender's BVH tree structures
- Batch ray processing for efficiency
- Falls back to CPU if GPU unavailable
- Up to 10x performance improvement

# Tips & Best Practices

## Performance Optimization
- Use low-poly meshes as helpers for faster processing. Icospheres work great.
- Enable GPU acceleration for point cloud generation
- Start with low ray density (8-16)
- Use stride to skip frames during point cloud generation
- Enable "Persistent Data" in the render animation step for faster Cycles rendering

## Quality Considerations
- Higher ray density = better quality but slower
- Helper face count - invalid cameras = camera count
- Interior detection may slow generation on complex scenes
- Helper meshes should encompass the target object

## Workflow Tips
- Plan camera coverage with simple helper geometry
- Use icospheres or cylinders for 360° coverage
- Preview camera path before exporting
- Test with small datasets first

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

**No cameras generated**
- Ensure helper meshes are added
- Check that meshes have faces (not just vertices/edges)
- Verify helper meshes are not deleted
- Verify cameras are not intersecting meshes

**GPU acceleration not working**
- Check Blender GPU compute settings
- Ensure compatible GPU drivers
- Falls back to CPU automatically

**Interior cameras still appearing**
- Enable "Skip Interior Cameras" option
- Check mesh normals are correct
- Ensure meshes are manifold (watertight)
